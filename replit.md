# KingDAO Treasury Dashboard

## Overview

The KingDAO Treasury Dashboard is a token-gated Web3 application designed for Kong NFT holders. Its primary purpose is to provide exclusive, real-time visibility into the DAO's financial treasury, governance activities, and community announcements. The platform aggregates data from various sources (Gnosis Safe, Dune Analytics, Google Sheets, on-chain RPC) to display comprehensive treasury assets, portfolio allocation, DAO-owned NFT holdings, community governance proposals from Snapshot, and Discord announcements. The dashboard features a modern, dark-themed glassmorphic interface, drawing inspiration from leading DeFi platforms, to offer a sophisticated and user-friendly experience for DAO members.

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

### Security Hardening
- **Server-side admin authentication**: Created POST `/api/auth/is-admin` endpoint with wallet signature verification. Admin addresses no longer exposed in client bundle (VITE_ADMIN_ADDRESSES removed).
- **Custom admin verification hook**: `useAdminStatus` handles signature requests, caching (4-minute staleTime), and comprehensive error states (loading, cancellation, network failures, access denial).
- **Error message sanitization**: Implemented `createErrorResponse` utility to prevent stack trace leakage in production. All 15+ API routes updated to use sanitized error responses.
- **Address validators**: Created `server/lib/validators.ts` with EVM and Solana address validation functions for future use.

### Architecture Improvements
- **Centralized shared exports**: `shared/index.ts` barrel file consolidates types, constants, and data for cleaner imports across frontend and backend.
- **Chain metadata**: Expanded `shared/constants.ts` with CHAIN_IDS, EXPLORERS, and SUPPORTED_CHAINS. Added chainId to all wallet objects for explorer link generation.
- **Reusable WalletCard component**: Created `client/src/components/WalletCard.tsx` to eliminate ~200 lines of duplication across Multi-Sig, DAO Wallets, and Tactical tabs.
- **Centralized mock data**: `shared/mockData.ts` consolidates all mock wallet balances for easy API integration in the future.
- **React Query caching**: Dashboard queries now use staleTime (1-5 minutes) and refetchInterval (5-10 minutes) for better performance and reduced API calls.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18+ and TypeScript using Vite, featuring a component-based SPA architecture with Wouter for client-side routing. UI components are styled with shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives) and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a dark glassmorphic design with purple/cyan gradients and custom fonts (Inter, Space Grotesk). State management primarily uses TanStack Query for server state and caching, with React context/hooks for local state. Data visualization is handled by Recharts, offering responsive charts for portfolio and performance tracking.

### Web3 Integration
Wallet connection is managed by Wagmi v2 and Viem for type-safe Ethereum interactions, including WalletConnect and injected wallet support. Token gating is implemented client-side using `useReadContract` to verify Kong NFT ownership (ERC721 contract: `0x6E3a2e08A88186f41ECD90E0683d9cA0983a4328`), with a server-side endpoint `/api/auth/holdings` for additional validation. This ensures access is restricted to Kong NFT holders.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js REST API developed with Node.js and TypeScript. It acts as a proxy and aggregator for various external services, centralizing API key management, performing data normalization, and mitigating CORS issues. Key integrations include Gnosis Safe API for multi-sig wallet balances, Dune Analytics for blockchain analytics (specifically for NFT floor prices), Google Sheets for manual treasury entries, Snapshot Hub for governance proposals, Discord for announcements, and Supabase for caching treasury snapshots.

### Database & Caching
The primary database utilizes PostgreSQL via Neon's serverless driver and Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. Supabase provides an additional PostgreSQL instance for treasury snapshot caching, enhancing data persistence and reducing external API calls. Frontend caching is handled by React Query.

### Authentication & Authorization
The primary access control is token-gating, verifying NFT ownership via blockchain reads on both client and server. The system is designed for a Web3-native authentication model, where Kong NFT ownership serves as the authorization ticket, with future plans for Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE).

### System Design
The dashboard features a tabbed interface for organizing treasury data into categories: NFT Collections, Crypto, Multi-Sig, DAO Wallets, and Tactical Wallets. The NFT Collections tab displays DAO-owned NFTs with links and token details. The Crypto tab presents total crypto holdings, portfolio distribution, and performance charts, including dedicated sections for DCA and other treasury tokens. DAO wallet structures are defined, categorizing controller, multi-sig, and tactical wallets, including support for Ethereum and Solana addresses.
