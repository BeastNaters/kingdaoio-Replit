Then render this in the NFT Collections tab:

Map over daoNftCollections

For each, show:

name

description

contract address (shortened)

“# Owned: {tokenIds.length}”

Placeholder “Est. Value: …” — if we already have an API route that returns floor prices for these collections, call it and multiply by tokenIds.length. If not, just show “Connect to floor price API to calculate.”

Total Value for NFT Collections

If floor-price endpoint exists (/api/dune/nft-floors or similar), fetch it and:

match by collection name or contract

total = sum(collectionFloor × collectionCount)

If it doesn’t exist yet, show a placeholder card with text:

“Total NFT Collection Value”

“Pending floor price integration”

========================================
OTHER TABS (STUB THEM OUT)

For the remaining tabs, create stubs so the dev team knows what to fill:

Crypto

Show “Total Crypto Holdings”

Table placeholder for token symbol, amount, USD value, source

Multi-Sig Wallets

Show “Total Multi-Sig Value”

Placeholder list for Gnosis Safe addresses + balances

DAO Wallets

Show “Total DAO Wallet Value”

Placeholder list of known DAO EOA addresses

DAO Tactical Wallets

Show “Total Tactical Wallet Value”

Placeholder description: “Short-term or tactical wallets used for trades, mints, operations.”

Make sure each of these has the SAME layout pattern so it’s consistent.

========================================
NOTES FOR FUTURE INTEGRATION

Comment in the code where to plug in Dune / floor price API for Rollbots, Sports Rollbots, and KING.

Comment in the code where to load these collections from Supabase instead of hardcoding.

Keep the contract addresses exactly as provided.

========================================
WHAT TO OUTPUT

Updated dashboard page (or component) with tabbed interface.

A new data file/constant for daoNftCollections.

Rendering logic for NFT Collections tab.

Stubs for the other four tabs with “Total Value” sections.

Any necessary TypeScript types if the project is using TS.

If your dashboard file is named something like app/dashboard/page.tsx or pages/dashboard.tsx, have Replit modify that file specifically. If it’s a component-based dashboard, have it add a new DashboardTabs component and import it.
