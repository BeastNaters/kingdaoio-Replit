Your job is to tell me everything this codebase needs from me (environment variables, external services, database tables, API keys, schema, and config) so that all integrations work smoothly when I hand it off to my dev team.

The app goals (so you know the intention):

Next.js/React dashboard for a DAO

Token-gated by holding a specific NFT on Ethereum mainnet

NFT contract: 0x6E3a2e08A88186f41ECD90E0683d9cA0983a4328

Snapshot space: kongsdao.eth

Integrations: Dune Analytics, Gnosis Safe (multi-sig), Google Sheets (service account), Supabase (for caching/storing snapshots), and some community views (Snapshot, Discord)

I need you to read the codebase and produce a step-by-step, very explicit checklist of what I (the project owner) must set up, so that another developer can pick this up and finish it.

Do the audit in SECTIONS like this:

1. Repo Scan / Structure

Identify the main framework (likely Next.js) and routing style (App Router vs Pages Router).

List the top-level folders you see (app/, pages/, components/, lib/, types/, app/api/..., etc.).

Tell me which parts look like MVP/placeholder code (e.g. mock data, commented-out fetches).

Point out any hardcoded addresses, query IDs, or placeholder strings related to Web3.

2. Environment Variables Required

Scan the codebase for all process.env.* usages.

Output a consolidated list of every env var the app expects.

For each env var, tell me:

where it’s used (file/path),

what service it belongs to (Dune, Google, Supabase, Safe, RPC, Snapshot, Discord),

whether it must be public (NEXT_PUBLIC_...) or server-side only,

and whether the current code is doing any special parsing (like replace(/\\n/g, '\n') for private keys).

If you see env vars referenced but not defined anywhere, call them out as MISSING.

Use this starting list and expand it based on the actual code:

NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (should be 0x6E3a2e08A88186f41ECD90E0683d9cA0983a4328)

DUNE_API_KEY

DUNE_TOKEN_PRICES_QUERY_ID

DUNE_NFT_FLOOR_PRICES_QUERY_ID

DUNE_WALLET_BALANCES_QUERY_ID

GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL

GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY

TREASURY_SPREADSHEET_ID

SNAPSHOT_SPACE (should be kongsdao.eth)

SAFE_TX_SERVICE_URL

SAFE_ADDRESS

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

Any Discord/Webhook env if present

Then tell me which of these must be added to:

.env.local (for local dev)

.env.example (for the repo so other devs know what to fill in)

3. Web3 / Token-Gating Check

Find the code that checks NFT ownership. Tell me:

which file does it in (e.g. lib/isHolder.ts, API route, or React hook),

which RPC it uses (Infura, Alchemy, or generic RPC from env),

which ABI it uses (ERC721?),

and whether the contract address is hardcoded or read from env.

If the contract is not set to 0x6E3a2e08A88186f41ECD90E0683d9cA0983a4328, tell me where to change it.

If the code assumes a certain chainId (e.g. 1 for mainnet), confirm it.

Tell me if the gating is done server-side, client-side, or both — and whether it’s bypassable right now.

4. Dune Analytics Integration

Find all API routes or helper files referencing Dune.

Tell me if they already fetch from https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/.../results or if they’re stubbed.

List exactly which query IDs the code expects. If they’re placeholders, say so.

Tell me what shape the code expects from Dune (e.g. { symbol, priceUsd }, { collection, floorPrice }, etc.).

Tell me what error handling exists (if Dune fails, does UI crash or show fallback?).

Tell me what I need to provide (real query IDs + API key).

5. Google Sheets Integration

Find the file that initializes Google Sheets (likely uses service account).

Tell me if the code is already set to parse GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY with line breaks.

Tell me which sheet name it expects (e.g. Treasury).

Tell me the column names it assumes.

Tell me what happens if the sheet is empty.

Output the exact Google Cloud setup I must do (create service account, share sheet with service account email, etc.).

6. Gnosis Safe (Treasury) Integration

Find the code that calls Safe Transaction Service.

Tell me the exact endpoint it’s using.

Tell me if it’s using a placeholder Safe address.

Tell me the data shape it expects (USD balances? raw token balances?).

Tell me what I must supply (real Safe address + network).

7. Supabase (IMPORTANT – I have NO TABLES YET)

I do not have any Supabase tables set up yet. I need you to:

Scan for any Supabase client initialization.

Scan for any code that does from('...'), insert, select, etc.

For each table name you find, output:

the table name

the columns the code expects

the data types you can infer

whether id is expected to be UUID or serial

whether RLS is assumed on or off

If the code does not define a schema, propose one based on the types in the codebase. For example, if there is a TreasurySnapshot type like:
