I need you to update the dashboard page so that the treasury view is more structured and broken into subcategories. Below are exact requirements — follow them closely.

========================================
GOAL

Keep the existing “Treasury dashboard” overview/compiler at the top (the high-level cards/summaries can stay), but add a set of clickable subcategory tabs underneath it. Each tab should show data relevant to a specific DAO-owned asset type and should include a “Total Value” section specific to that tab.

The subcategory tabs should be:

NFT Collections

Crypto

Multi-Sig Wallets

DAO Wallets

DAO Tactical Wallets

Assume some of these data sources might be coming from APIs later — so set it up in a way that is easy to plug in real data.

========================================
COMPONENT / UI REQUIREMENTS

Under the main dashboard header/overview, add a tabbed interface. If we already have a component library (shadcn/ui or similar), use its Tabs component. If not, create a simple tab system with local state.

Each tab should render its own panel/component.

At the top of each tab’s panel, render a Total Value card/section that is specific to that category. For now, if we don’t have real valuation data for all categories, you can:

leave placeholder totals,

or calculate from provided arrays,

but make sure the structure is there: Total Value for NFT Collections, Total Value for Crypto, etc.

Keep styling consistent with the rest of the app (dark, Web3, rounded corners).

========================================
FOCUS TAB: NFT Collections

Build out the NFT Collections tab more completely than the others because I have real data for this.

What this tab should show:

A header section: “DAO-Owned NFT Collections”

A short description: “These are collections held by the DAO. Values are estimated from floor price data.”

A per-collection card / banner that is clickable (can route to a detail view later or just open a panel).

Each collection card should show:

Collection name

Brief description

Contract address

How many NFTs we own from that collection

Estimated total value for that collection (can be floor price × quantity if floor data is available)

Links area (placeholder) for “View on Etherscan / OpenSea / relevant info”

You can hardcode the 3 collections for now:

Rollbots

Owned token IDs (array of numbers):
